    "# Weekly Discussion Forum Participation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each week, you are required to participate in the module’s discussion forum. The discussion forum consists of the week's Module Activity, which is released at the beginning of the module. You must complete/attempt the activity before you can post about the activity and anything that relates to the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading of the Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Initial Post:\n",
    "Create your thread by **Day 5 (Saturday night at midnight, PST).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Responses:\n",
    "Respond to at least two other posts by **Day 7 (Monday night at midnight, PST).**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading Criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your participation will be graded as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Credit (100 points):\n",
    "- Submit your initial post by **Day 5.**\n",
    "- Respond to at least two other posts by **Day 7.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Half Credit (50 points):\n",
    "- If your initial post is late but you respond to two other posts.\n",
    "- If your initial post is on time but you fail to respond to at least two other posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No Credit (0 points):\n",
    "- If both your initial post and responses are late.\n",
    "- If you fail to submit an initial post and do not respond to any others.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Late Initial Posts:** Late posts will automatically receive half credit if two responses are completed on time.\n",
    "- **Substance Matters:** Responses must be thoughtful and constructive. Comments like “Great post!” or “I agree!” without further explanation will not earn credit.\n",
    "- **Balance Participation:** Aim to engage with threads that have fewer or no responses to ensure a balanced discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Avoid:\n",
    "- A number of posts within a very short time-frame, especially immediately prior to the posting deadline.\n",
    "- Posts that complement another post, and then consist of a summary of that.\n"

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Extend the Algorithm\n",
    "Modify the code to run over multiple iterations. Implement:\n",
    "- **A maximum iteration count** to limit the number of iterations.\n",
    "- **A stopping criterion** based on convergence (e.g., a small change in parameter values between iterations).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2: Analyze Runtime\n",
    "Add line-by-line runtime comments to the code to measure the execution time of each section. Using these measurements, derive the **runtime complexity** of the algorithm in terms of the number of data points (\\(n\\)) and components (\\(k\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Extending the Algorithm\n",
    "1. Add a `for` loop or `while` loop to iterate over the Expectation-Maximization steps until:\n",
    "   - A **maximum number of iterations** is reached (e.g., 100).\n",
    "   - The parameter values (`mu`, `sigma`, `pk`) converge, i.e., the change in values is below a predefined threshold (e.g., \\(10^{-4}\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modify the algorithm to check for convergence at the end of each iteration:\n",
    "   - Use a metric like the **norm of the difference in means** (`mu`) or the **log-likelihood** of the data.\n",
    "   - Print the number of iterations the algorithm required before convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Analyzing Runtime\n",
    "1. Import Python's `time` module and measure the runtime of each section of the code:\n",
    "   - **Initialization**: Measure the time to compute the initial `mu`, `sigma`, and `pk`.\n",
    "   - **E-Step**: Measure the time to compute probabilities and numerators.\n",
    "   - **M-Step**: Measure the time to update the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add comments next to each runtime measurement to document how long the operation took.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using the runtimes, analyze the algorithm's complexity:\n",
    "   - Consider \\(n\\), the number of data points.\n",
    "   - Consider \\(k\\), the number of Gaussian components.\n",
    "   - Derive the overall runtime complexity as a function of \\(n\\) and \\(k\\).\n"
